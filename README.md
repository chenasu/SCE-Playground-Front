SCE-PLAYGROUND is a  project built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It provides an interactive and dynamic environment where users can explore various features, sign up, and log in. 

Both the frontend and backend are essential parts of this application and need to be running simultaneously for everything to work properly.
How to Run the Project Locally
To run SCE-PLAYGROUND locally, you need to set up both the frontend and backend repositories.

Please follow the steps below to get everything running.
## **1. Clone the Repositories**
First, clone both the frontend and backend repositories to your local machine.

Clone the frontend repository
**Frontend Repository Link:**

git clone https://github.com/chenasu/SCE-Playground-Front.git
